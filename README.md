# CSDS234_FinalProject

In the modern age of streaming, playlists have become a cornerstone in modern music consumption, shaping how we enjoy personalized music and discover new songs. Music streaming platforms like Spotify have capitalized on this fact, not only serving as a platform for users to create and share playlists but also generating uniquely curated playlists for each of their listeners. In light of this, our project aims to explore two common playlist recommendation models — the content-based method and collaborative filtering method — investigating how their algorithms work as well as assessing their benefits and limitations. To aid with our investigations, the dataset that we will be analyzing is Spotify’s Million Playlist Dataset, containing over 1 million playlists created by US Spotify users between January 2010 and November 2017. From this data set, we used a sample of 1000 playlists to implement the two recommendation models. After comparing the performances of these two algorithms, we can quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate each based on the precision of their recommendations. Our exploration will offer invaluable insights into the future of personalized playlists that will no doubt influence our music-listening experiences.
